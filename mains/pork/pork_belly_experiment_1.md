pork belly 
- brined for a day (with a few drops of liquid apple smoke?)
- sous vide for a day nice and low on its own, no fuckery, ice bath.
- rebagged with rice wine vinegar and a few drops of liquid apple smoke, put in fridge for a day to settle

* pork itself should be rich, fatty, crisp and slightly smoked. no impinging flavours

puy lentils

* should be the absolute selling point of the dish, bridge rich mouthfeel of pork and its fat with the density and feel of puy lentis

celery - raw / blanched - unsure yet however i feel this may be another main part of the dish - the freshness required in the rich fat maelstrom

smoked almonds? - would need to wash the salt off, too strong. however i think almonds may really add something
caperberrys? - maybe the vinegar is too much, though the cheese caperberry almond trio is super strong.
sharp cheddar? it could conflicts too much and tries to take centre stage, if used it should be a miniscule amount diced super fine ~2-4mm

sauce:

- reduced jus - for sure if we want the residual smokiness from cooking. i dont think adding any more liquid smoke would do any good at this point - would unbalance and bring too much focus onto the smoke
- white wine? if not white wine vinegar to nod to traditional puy lentil preparation
- pork gelatin from bag - to maintain mouthfeel - especially if paired with celeriac

mustard as a bridge? maybe too strong - should be english i feel here, too much going on in dijon and wholegrain. regardless the amount should be small

other thoughts:
- cucumber - although incredibly aromatic on its own, may have to pare this back. great with lentils though - investigate
- oyster sauce for asian angle? - may be too much of a wildcard, but could handle fennel/anise flavours quite nicely
- celery root / celeriac puree - maybe a bed over the lentis onto which belly is placed? then make a gelatin based jus to go around the bed of lentis?
- artichoke - just the tits, but hard to incorporate without it seeming like an obvious extra
- bacon / lardons / panchetta - fits with the smokey theme? needs to be cut up mega small with lentils to contain is to be included, or maybe as a course addition to a card mash on top?
- cabbage / kale - repeating element in pork dishes though maybe too much faff for something so implicitly focussed, another possible area to hide above meats in
- carrot? adds some sweetness and a nice colour if added to lentils, could handle cheddar and the almonds quite well i feel
- star anise / fennel / chervil? (i said no aromatics, but fuck it anise is the best flavour and i think it _might_ just go with the light smokey theme)
- brussel sprouts - fit with the smokey bacon quite nicely, but if included need to be minimals and cut up into 1/4s maximum, probably 1/8ths
- diced black olives - could this hide well in the puy lentis? or serve as too much of a distraction?

NO AROMATICS.
