pork belly attempy #1

3/4 teaspoon ish brown sugar
good pinch or two or salt
3-4 drops liquid smoke
good glug of rice wine vinegar
pork belly 0.55kg

nightmare sealing the fucker on account of the liquid volume (good for one table spoon my ass)
left sat in bag in fridge overnight to kind of marinade, rest, brine, whatever.
- didnt use prague powder, was unsure, next time maybe. im not sold sold on the pinkness thing outside of corned beef and intense bbq smoke imitation
- also didnt brine - sealing the night before in vinegar salt and liquid smoke might do the trick though

put in cooker at 70c for 16 hours (8:45am to 0:50am)
lots of juices - hoping for them to turn to a tonne of smokey gelatin
put in ice bath for 30 mins
